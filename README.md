# About

This is a simple Rails 3.1 app that uses [parse_resource](http://github.com/adelevie/parse_resource) for model persistence and includes a simple auth system that's based on this [Railscast](http://asciicasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch).

If you already use Parse, this Rails app is a really quick way to give your app a web presence.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:adelevie/parse-rails-boilerplate.git`

`cd parse-rails-boilerplate`

Change application names where necessary, if desired.

`bundle install`

Create a `parse_resource.yml` file. Instructions [here](https://github.com/adelevie/parse_resource/blob/master/README.md).

`rails s` and enjoy.
